# TTSMixmaster

A comprehensive tool for exporting your favorite playlists and collections to Tabletop Simulator playlist chips, designed for use with the [Music Box](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114355269). This application allows you to fetch playlists and collections from multiple music services including Last.fm, YouTube, and Spotify, download MP3 files, upload them to Azure Blob Storage, and generate formatted Lua code for use in Tabletop Simulator.

## üåü Major Update: Multi-Service Integration

TTSMixmaster has been completely overhauled with multi-service support! The application now features:

- **Unified Interface**: Single "Collections & Playlists" tab supporting Last.fm, YouTube, and Spotify
- **Service Abstraction**: Clean architecture separating different music services
- **Enhanced Configuration**: Individual API credentials and connection testing for each service
- **Terminology Accuracy**: Properly distinguishes Last.fm "collections" from true playlists
- **Flexible Usage**: Use only the services you need - all API credentials are optional
