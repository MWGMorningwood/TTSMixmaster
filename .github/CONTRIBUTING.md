## Coding Guidelines

### Python Code Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use dataclasses for data structures where appropriate
- Include docstrings for all classes and functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Organization
- Follow the existing module structure in `src/`
- Keep related functionality together in appropriate modules
- Use the service abstraction layer for new music service integrations
- Handle exceptions gracefully with proper error messages
- Use logging for debugging and information messages

### Example Code Style
```python
from typing import List, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Track:
    """Represents a music track with metadata."""
    artist: str
    title: str
    duration: Optional[int] = None
    url: Optional[str] = None

def fetch_tracks(service_name: str, limit: int = 50) -> List[Track]:
    """
    Fetch tracks from a music service.
    
    Args:
        service_name: Name of the music service
        limit: Maximum number of tracks to fetch
        
    Returns:
        List of Track objects
        
    Raises:
        ServiceError: If the service is unavailable
    """
    try:
        # Implementation here
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to fetch tracks from {service_name}: {e}")
        raise ServiceError(f"Service {service_name} unavailable") from e
```

### GUI Development
- Use CustomTkinter for UI components
- Follow the existing tab structure and layout patterns
- Include progress indicators for long-running operations
- Provide clear error messages and user feedback
- Test UI changes on different screen sizes and themes

### API Integration
- Follow the service abstraction pattern in `src/api/base_service.py`
- Implement proper error handling and rate limiting
- Use environment variables for API credentials
- Include connection testing functionality
- Document API requirements and setup steps

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run basic functionality tests
python tests/test_basic.py

# Run multi-service integration tests
python tests/test_multi_service.py

# Run specific test files
python tests/test_your_feature.py
```

### Writing Tests
- Add tests for new features in the `tests/` directory
- Include both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Mock external API calls in unit tests
- Use descriptive test names and include docstrings

### Test Structure Example
```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from src.api.your_service import YourService

class TestYourService(unittest.TestCase):
    """Test cases for YourService integration."""
    
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test fixtures."""
        self.service = YourService("test-api-key")
    
    def test_fetch_playlists_success(self):
        """Test successful playlist fetching."""
        # Test implementation
        pass
    
    @patch('src.api.your_service.requests.get')
    def test_fetch_playlists_api_error(self, mock_get):
        """Test handling of API errors."""
        # Test implementation with mocked API call
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
