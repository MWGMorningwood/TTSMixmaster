## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **FFmpeg Error (`'FFmpegPostProcessorPP'`)**: 
   - Make sure you've installed all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Import errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and you're using the correct virtual environment

3. **API connection failed**: Check your Last.fm API credentials in your `.env` file

4. **Download failures**: Verify internet connection and try different search engines

5. **Upload issues**: Ensure SteamCMD is installed and Steam credentials are correct

### Dependencies Not Installing
